## Tecnical questions and answers:

2. Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?
2A. My main experience is in PHP (13+ years) and the role is for PHP developer.

3. What is your favourite thing about your most familar PHP framework (Laravel / Symfony etc)?
3A. However, I choose to do this test with framework I worked more with Laravel in the last few years.
I like the small footprint, Routing and Eloquent library also that is RAD and designed for API development.

4. What is your least favourite thing about the above framework?
4A. However, Laravel is designed for API and (micro)Service development, the real good templating engine (Blade) is embended with. 
In many cases, when Laravel is used for integrations or API development, not need to have templating engine as just data returned (mostly JSON).
